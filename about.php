                <p>I'm a trainer, for the last 13 years that's what I've done. I always had a love for linux and for programming and in my job I have had occasion from time to time to let some of that out. I put up this site as an outlet, it is coded in <code>CakePHP</code>. I love PHP and Cake makes things very easy since it's a free, open-source, rapid development framework for PHP. It's a foundational structure for programmers to create web applications.</p>
                <p>Mind you, I have taken on <code>Ruby on Rails</code> and absolutely loved it, very fast, very quick development, but I ended up back on PHP only because it's my personal favorite.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I have <code>CCNA Security</code> certification, I work on routers in my day job, and quiet like teaching others about how they work and are configured. This site is a useful wiki for my own needs and I hope others may find it of some use too.</p>
